📌 Go Auto Vehicle Mileage Classification 🚗📊
A machine learning project to classify vehicles into mileage categories for better dealership insights.

🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying vehicles into Low, Mid, and High mileage categories using machine learning techniques. The classification helps dealerships optimize vehicle marketing strategies and improve decision-making based on customer preferences.

🎯 Key Objectives:
Develop a multi-class classification model to categorize vehicles based on mileage.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the dataset.
Build and evaluate machine learning models for accurate classification.
Enhance dealership strategies through data-driven insights.
📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of real-world vehicle data from Go Auto, including:
✅ Mileage (target variable)
✅ Vehicle Make & Model
✅ Year & Price
✅ Other key attributes affecting mileage classification
